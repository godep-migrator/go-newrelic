go-newrelic
===========

NewRelic instrumentation for Go!

:boom: PRE-ALPHA JUST DON'T DO IT :boom:

If you need something right now, considering using
[gorelic](https://github.com/yvasiyarov/gorelic).

This thing is based largely on the [Ruby
implementation](https://github.com/newrelic/rpm), not least so that it
(maybe???) someday is supported by NewRelic.
